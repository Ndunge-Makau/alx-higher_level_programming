Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

* Prototype: def find_peak(list_of_integers):
* You are not allowed to import any module
* Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you donâ€™t need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
* 6-peak.py must contain the function
* 6-peak.txt must contain the complexity of your algorithm: O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
* Note: there may be more than one peak in the list

File: <b>6-peak.py, 6-peak.txt</b>
